# VdoLokan

Project title is a bit of word-play joining **Video** and  Sanskrit word **Lokan**
(लोकन, meaning _seeing_ or _act of looking_).

Aim is to create a standalone web application using **ExpressJS**, **Angular** and
**Angular Material** to serve video files stored in a directory. Support for other
media files may be added later.

## Status

Project is currently at prototype stage.
